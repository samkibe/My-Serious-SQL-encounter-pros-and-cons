- Microsoft store would not allow me to download ubuntu in peace, it would through me an error after downloading 1.2MBS of the file everytime, it was very frustrating.
I at one time decided to retry for a 1.2MB click to UPTO 750MBS almost a thousand clicks, unfortunately with so many hits it hit the cancel indefinately takinng me back to the start at 0MBS.

- After some promising research i decide to download an ubuntu ISO image then install it by writing it into a bootable USB drive using #RUFUS.
- CAUTION microsoft bothers you with technical nonsense if you do not ever/or always update windows, so basically thats why i went through the back door to do my Docker setup and installation, it was worthit anyway, because i learned alot.
