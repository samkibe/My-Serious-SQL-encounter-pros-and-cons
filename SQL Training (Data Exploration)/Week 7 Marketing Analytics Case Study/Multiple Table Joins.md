#### The key columns that we will need to generate include the following data points at a customer_id level:

- category_name: The name of the top 2 ranking categories
- rental_count: How many total films have they watched in this category
- average_comparison: How many more films has the customer watched compared to the 
- average DVD Rental Co customer
- percentile: How does the customer rank in terms of the top X% compared to all other customers in this film category?
- category_percentage: What proportion of total films watched does this category make up?

#### THEN We need to generate the rental_count calculation - the number of films that a customer has watched in a specific category.
- EG SELECT
 customer_id,
  COUNT(*) AS rental_count
FROM `dvd_rentals.rental`
GROUP BY
  customer_id;

###   OR SHOW Show ALL rentals made by A CUSTOMER USING THEIR ID EG customer_id = 130:
- SELECT *
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
WHERE customer_id = 130;
